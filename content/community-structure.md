Using the Louvain clustering algorithm, we optimize for modularity score and get a partitioning with a modularity of around 0.35. Giving us an approximately 36% and 75% percent increase compared to party-chamber and party-party partioning respectively, indicating that there indeed is a third dimension to the way the congressial communities organize themselves, beyond party and party-chamber.

In the matrix below, we have compared how the members of the different parties have spread themselves out across the Louvain-based partitionings. The communities are ranked after member size, and the number in each element represents how many members of that specific row's political affiliation are in the chosen community, measured in percentage.

We see that the two political parties tend to concentrate the majority of their members in two seperate communities, with approximately 75% of all republicans being in the largest community, 80% of democrats in the second largest. There is very little overlap between the communities that democrats and republicans are affiliated with. It therefore appears, that our optimal partitioning still generates polarization, which is a strong indicator for the fact, that there is polarization within the US congress.
<!-- We see this in the way, that the different communities are divided so heavily along party line. We will now investigate, whether or not the different communities are centered around policy issues.  -->

## Analysis of the communities splits
We will now analyse these splits to see if they are centered around parties, policy issues, or something else.
As a proxy measure for this, we will look at the most central node in each community, measured by indegree centrality, and see whether or not it is a caucus or a committee. We use this measure as it seems reasonable that if we have a community heavily centered around eks. the Committee for Climate Change, we assume that the communication in that community is also centered on discussing on climate change. This assumption that the most contral node represent the communities well is based on the fact that our graph follows a power law with regards to edges. Which means that the most central nodes in each community have a majority share of the mentions. However, this may not hold for all communites, as we have only proved it for the full network, and there may therefore be a case of many high-centrality nodes being grouped together in the same community.

If there is a high centrality around non-partisan committees, we assume this to mean, that the communication done in that community are centered around the subject, which the committee is itself centered around. That is, if we have a community heavily centered around the Committee for Climate Change, we assume that the communication in that community is centered on discussing climate change. 

We assume that the most central nodes represent the communities well, as our graph follows a power law with regards to edges. This tells us, that 20% of the nodes have approximately 80% or more of the edges, which should mean that the most central nodes in each community should have a major share of the mentions. However, this may not be true, as our power law is on a network wide-scale, and there may therefore be a case of many high-centrality nodes being grouped together in the same community.

As a way to measure polarization in the different communities we will also employ the measure "partisanship," which is calculated by first finding out how big a percentage of the community is republican and how big a percentage is democratic, and taking the maximum of that. This means, that we have a range of partisanship from [0,1], where 0 indicates that 0% of the members belong to any political party, and 1 indicates that 100% of the members belong to the same party. These measures have been plottet below.

When running a single sample of the Louvain algorithm, we see, that the smallest communities have a low value of partisanship, showing how they're very much not polarized. And at the same time, the central nodes of these communities have a very high centrality, which indicates, that they're the focus of the communication taking place in those communities. 

Looking at the number of edges inside of these 4 smallest communities, we see however, they're considerably smaller than the top 4 communities; Making up only 3.5% of the total edges in the network. They therefore make up a minor part of the modularity calculations, and are therefore most likely not the reason for why we saw such a huge increase in the modularity, when running the Louvain algorithm opposed to simply partitioning among party- or party-chamber lines.

We see that these communities, which can be considered the most important with regards to the modularity, have very high partisanship and very low centrality. Under the assumption, that high centrality around a single node is a measure of how much a community's tweets are focused around that person, subject or party. And that partisanship is a true measure for how polarized the communities are. It appears, that despite one of the biggest community's central nodes being a committee, the low centrality of this committee tells us, that it is not the locus of the communication taking place in that community.

Rather, it appears, that the common pattern for the largest communities is, that they're very much polarized.  With the lowest partisanship being around 0.8, meaning that 80% of the third and fourth largest networks' members are part of the same party. While the largest communities, who make up the lion's share of congress members, have a partisanship north of 0.85.

Pertaining to our hypothesis that the increase in modularity - and therefore the quality of communities - was based on the Louvain algorithm creating groupings based on policy-issues, appears to be false. This is due to the fact, that we expected this policy-focus to be manifested in a high centrality around certain policy-focused users, like caucuses or committees which are usually single issue based. Instead we found, that amongst the top 4 communities, which made up approx. 98% of the congress members, only the second largest community was centered around a committee user. But even then, it had a very low centrality, and was therefore most likely not the locus of communication in that community. However nothing definitve can be concluded regarding this, besides our measure of policy-focus not manifesting itself.

So in summation, combined with the previous page, it appears that there is a strong argument to make for the existence of polarization in the US congress. Besides the points from the previous page, we see that republicans and democrats fundamentally engage in different communities. We furthermore cannot conclude anything about whether or not the Louvain algorithm's partitionings having such a higher modularity is based on the communities being centered around policy-issues instead of around party-chamber lines, as the proxy measure we used to measure this did not manifest itself.

Based on all of these factors, we've decided to investigate the communities through text analysis, rather than community measures, to get a better understanding of what binds these communities together.
