The United States Congress is the legislature of the United States Government [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress). It is responsible for creating and ractifying exisitnig laws. It is composed of two chambers. The senate with 100 elected officials and the house with 435 elected officials giving a total of 534. All members of both houses are elected by the public which means that they all need to have good public relations. In todays world, one of the best ways to reach out to the public is through social media. As it allows for easy communication with other elected officials and the public.

It seems like there is a lot of talk in the news about polarization in US politics between democrats and republicans. We would like to explore whether this polarization exists in reality, that is, do democrats and republicans actually never cooperate, or this just an image potrayed by the media?
As a proxy measurement for this, we've decided to look at twitter exchanges between members of the U.S congress and organization related to these in order to look for patterns that may tell us, how the U.S congress communciates. Our data consists of tweets made by members of congress, governmental organization and caucuses from 2017-2023 including data such as political affiliation and region of the different political users. The dataset is described in the [Dataset](https://christian-kento-rasmussen.github.io/US-Congress-Twitter-Behavior/data-description) page.

Specifically, we start off by investigating the relationship between democrats and republicans to establish, whether our big community (the U.S congress) can in fact be divided into seperate communities based on political affiliation. We do this by looking at the modularity of dividing the users into communities based on political affiliation. We also look at the assortativity between the different political affiliation in the section [Network-structure](https://christian-kento-rasmussen.github.io/US-Congress-Twitter-Behavior/network-structure).

Should our hypothesis, that the U.S congress is polarized not undoubtadly hold, we would like to investiage what relations that actually best describe the way the U.S congress communicates and organizes itself. We do this by dividing the different Twitter users into communities with the help of the Louvain algorithm in page [Community-structure](https://christian-kento-rasmussen.github.io/US-Congress-Twitter-Behavior/community-structure). 

From here we would like to see, what underlying structures, if not political party, that binds the different communities together. Is it a special commitee that they talk a lot about, a law or a maybe a more general topic like foreign policy or welfare? We do this in page  [Congressional-communities](https://christian-kento-rasmussen.github.io/US-Congress-Twitter-Behavior/congressional-communities) by doing text analysis on the biggest communities to see which keywords that describe them best. 

Finally, we would like to see, how the relationship between democrats and republicans has changed over the years. We do this by looking at the democrat-republican modularity and associativity throughout the years.
